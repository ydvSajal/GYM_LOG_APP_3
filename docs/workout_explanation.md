# Line-by-Line Explanation of WorkoutManager.java

```java
package GYM_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM.src;  // Package declaration matching the directory structure

import java.util.ArrayList;  // Import ArrayList for storing workouts
import java.util.Scanner;    // Import Scanner for user input

public class WorkoutManager {  // Class to manage all workout-related operations
    // Instance variables
    private ArrayList<Workout> workouts;     // Stores all workout records
    private Scanner scanner;                 // Scanner for user input
    private MemberManager memberManager;     // Reference to MemberManager for validation

    // Constructor
    public WorkoutManager(MemberManager memberManager) {
        workouts = new ArrayList<>();        // Initialize empty workouts list
        scanner = new Scanner(System.in);    // Initialize scanner for input
        this.memberManager = memberManager;  // Store reference to MemberManager
    }

    // Method to record a new workout
    public void recordWorkout() {
        System.out.print("Enter member ID: ");  // Prompt for member ID
        int memberId = scanner.nextInt();       // Get member ID from user
        scanner.nextLine();                     // Consume newline character

        // Validate member exists
        if (memberManager.findMember(memberId) == null) {
            System.out.println("Member not found!");  // Error message if member doesn't exist
            return;                                  // Exit method
        }

        System.out.print("Enter exercise name: ");  // Prompt for exercise name
        String exercise = scanner.nextLine();       // Get exercise name
        
        System.out.print("Enter duration (in minutes): ");  // Prompt for duration
        int duration = scanner.nextInt();                    // Get duration
        scanner.nextLine();                                 // Consume newline

        // Create and store new workout
        String date = java.time.LocalDate.now().toString();  // Get current date
        Workout workout = new Workout(memberId, date, exercise, duration);  // Create new workout
        workouts.add(workout);                              // Add to workouts list
        System.out.println("Workout recorded successfully!");  // Success message
    }

    // Method to display workouts for a specific member
    public void displayMemberWorkouts(int memberId) {
        System.out.println("\nRecent Workouts:");  // Header for workout display
        for (Workout workout : workouts) {         // Loop through all workouts
            if (workout.getMemberId() == memberId) {  // Check if workout belongs to member
                // Display workout details
                System.out.println("Date: " + workout.getDate() + 
                                 ", Exercise: " + workout.getExercise() + 
                                 ", Duration: " + workout.getDuration() + " minutes");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Detailed Explanation

### Class Structure
1. The class is declared as `public` to be accessible from other packages
2. Uses instance variables to maintain workout data and dependencies
3. Implements methods for workout recording and display

### Key Components

#### 1. Instance Variables
```java
private ArrayList<Workout> workouts;
private Scanner scanner;
private MemberManager memberManager;
```
- `workouts`: Stores all workout records
- `scanner`: Handles user input
- `memberManager`: Reference to validate members

#### 2. Constructor
```java
public WorkoutManager(MemberManager memberManager)
```
- Initializes all instance variables
- Takes MemberManager as parameter for validation
- Sets up data structures and input handling

#### 3. Workout Recording
```java
public void recordWorkout()
```
- Collects workout information from user
- Validates member existence
- Creates and stores new workout record

#### 4. Workout Display
```java
public void displayMemberWorkouts(int memberId)
```
- Shows all workouts for a specific member
- Formats workout information for display
- Filters workouts by member ID

## Data Flow

### 1. Recording a Workout
1. Get member ID from user
2. Validate member exists
3. Get exercise details
4. Create new workout record
5. Store in workouts list

### 2. Displaying Workouts
1. Receive member ID
2. Loop through workouts
3. Filter by member ID
4. Display formatted information

## Error Handling

1. **Member Validation**
   - Checks if member exists before recording workout
   - Provides clear error message if member not found

2. **Input Handling**
   - Properly consumes newline characters
   - Handles different input types (int, String)

## Design Considerations

1. **Data Management**
   - Uses ArrayList for flexible storage
   - Maintains workout history

2. **User Interface**
   - Clear prompts for input
   - Formatted output display

3. **Integration**
   - Works with MemberManager for validation
   - Maintains data consistency

## Example Usage

### Recording a Workout
```java
workoutManager.recordWorkout();
// Expected input sequence:
// 1. Member ID (e.g., 1001)
// 2. Exercise name (e.g., "Running")
// 3. Duration (e.g., 30)
```

### Displaying Workouts
```java
workoutManager.displayMemberWorkouts(1001);
// Expected output:
// Recent Workouts:
// Date: 2024-03-20, Exercise: Running, Duration: 30 minutes
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Encapsulation**
   - Private instance variables
   - Public methods for operations

2. **Input Validation**
   - Member existence check
   - Proper input type handling

3. **Data Organization**
   - Structured workout records
   - Efficient storage and retrieval

4. **User Experience**
   - Clear prompts and messages
   - Formatted output display
