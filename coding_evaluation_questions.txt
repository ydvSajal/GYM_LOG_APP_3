# Gym Management System - Coding Evaluation Questions

## Basic Level Questions

### Member Class Implementation
1. What is the purpose of the Member class constructor?
   Answer: The constructor initializes a new Member object with:
   ```java
   public Member(int id, String name, int age, String membershipType) {
       this.id = id;
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
       this.membershipType = membershipType;
       this.joinDate = LocalDate.now().toString();
       this.status = "Active";
       this.height = 0.0;
       this.weight = 0.0;
       this.bmi = 0.0;
   }
   ```
   It sets default values for joinDate, status, height, weight, and bmi.

2. Why are getters and setters used in the Member class?
   Answer: Getters and setters provide controlled access to private fields:
   - Encapsulation: Fields are private and can only be accessed through methods
   - Validation: Setters can include validation logic (e.g., BMI calculation)
   - Flexibility: Implementation can change without affecting other code
   - Data integrity: Controlled modification of member data

3. How is BMI calculated in the Member class?
   Answer: BMI is calculated in the private calculateBMI() method:
   ```java
   private void calculateBMI() {
       if (height > 0 && weight > 0) {
           this.bmi = weight / (height * height);
       }
   }
   ```
   It's called automatically when height or weight is set.

4. What is the purpose of the toString() method in Member class?
   Answer: The toString() method provides a formatted string representation of a member:
   ```java
   @Override
   public String toString() {
       return "Member ID: " + id + "\n" +
              "Name: " + name + "\n" +
              "Age: " + age + "\n" +
              "Membership Type: " + membershipType + "\n" +
              "Height: " + String.format("%.2f", height) + "m\n" +
              "Weight: " + String.format("%.2f", weight) + "kg\n" +
              "BMI: " + String.format("%.2f", bmi) + " (" + getBMIStatus() + ")\n" +
              "Join Date: " + joinDate + "\n" +
              "Status: " + status;
   }
   ```
   It formats member data for display.

5. How does the getBMIStatus() method work?
   Answer: The method categorizes BMI values:
   ```java
   public String getBMIStatus() {
       if (bmi < 18.5) return "Underweight";
       else if (bmi < 25) return "Normal weight";
       else if (bmi < 30) return "Overweight";
       else return "Obese";
   }
   ```
   It returns a string based on BMI ranges.

### MemberManager Class Implementation
1. How does MemberManager initialize member data?
   Answer: The constructor loads existing members and sets the next ID:
   ```java
   public MemberManager() {
       members = DataStorage.loadMembers();
       nextId = members.stream()
                      .mapToInt(Member::getId)
                      .max()
                      .orElse(0) + 1;
   }
   ```
   It uses Java streams to find the highest ID.

2. What is the purpose of the registerNewMember method?
   Answer: The method creates and adds a new member:
   ```java
   public void registerNewMember(String name, int age, String membershipType) {
       Member member = new Member(nextId++, name, age, membershipType);
       members.add(member);
       DataStorage.saveMembers(members);
   }
   ```
   It auto-increments the ID and saves to storage.

3. How does getMember handle member lookup?
   Answer: The method uses Optional to safely handle member lookup:
   ```java
   public Member getMember(int id) {
       Optional<Member> member = members.stream()
                                      .filter(m -> m.getId() == id)
                                      .findFirst();
       return member.orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException("Member not found with ID: " + id));
   }
   ```
   It throws an exception if member not found.

4. What is the purpose of the getAllMembersInfo method?
   Answer: The method creates a formatted string of all members:
   ```java
   public String getAllMembersInfo() {
       StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
       for (Member member : members) {
           sb.append(member.toString()).append("\n");
       }
       return sb.toString();
   }
   ```
   It uses StringBuilder for efficient string concatenation.

5. How does updateMember handle member updates?
   Answer: The method updates member fields and saves changes:
   ```java
   public void updateMember(int memberId, String name, int age, String membershipType) {
       Member member = getMember(memberId);
       member.setName(name);
       member.setAge(age);
       member.setMembershipType(membershipType);
       DataStorage.saveMembers(members);
   }
   ```
   It persists changes to storage.
